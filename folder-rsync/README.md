# folder-rsync

## About this addon

This repository is forked from https://github.com/carstenschroeder/hassio-addons, and uses contributions from forks https://github.com/LinusHoppe/hassio-addons/ and https://github.com/thywolf/hassio-addons.

This simple addon transfers the Hass.io folders /homeassistant, /addon_configs, /backup, /share, /ssl and /media to a remote rsync server (e.g. a Synology NAS).

The addon transfers the changes to the destination at every start. After the transfer it stops.
